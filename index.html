        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business ManagementðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently an 18 year old first year student at the University of California Riverside. Throughout my years of high school and younger years of education I have committed to success and become motivated into engaging in situations that are beyond my control in order to prepare for endless opportunities for the future. Being enrolled into the university as a business major, I am offered great help from all professors and peers in my classes and college. All my professors have been very open with discussioning any help I may need from them or if I have any problems or concerns with anything in class or even outside of class. Considering being a first year student this type of comfort from staff made me feel confident and comfortable to continue my path in my education.<br><br>

        Due to the current pandemic of Covid-19, school has been an activity that takes up a lot of my energy to participate in. Not because one can consider it boring or challenging, but because of the fact that I've always been that engaged and passionate leaner in a classroom environment. Now that online virtual learning has become the new way of learning and communicating it has been difficult to adjust to considering I don't like my bedroom being a learning environment. This has affected my performance in all my classes this fall quarter for the worse. I always notice myself dozing off during my zoom lectures or getting distracted with my surrounding environment. Sometimes I tend to use my cellphone and scroll through social media but my favorite thing i like to do during class is talking to my mother that I hardly see. Considering she works an afternoon night shift, I am always busy with school in the morning and spend little time with my mother as she goes to work after my classes and doesnâ€™t come home until midnight when Iâ€™m ready to go to bed. Overall i can say that my performance from this first school year shouldnâ€™t be seen as warning signs as it may not accurately reflect my dedication and passion for learning and working. Hopefully that this pandemic can end soon that way i can work and perform to my best ability in a classroom setting.<br><br>

        Moving forward with my difficulties that have been conveyed I have always kept myself busy with distracting myself by keeping up with important hobbies that have impacted my life and have formed the way I am today as a person. As it may not seem as a serious hobby, gaming has easily become one of the most essential hobbies that has shaped many characteristics that I have. Playing video games has given me the mentality to achieve and continue to pursue my goals no matter how long it may take. A lot of the times when trying to adapt to new meta changes in a video game, the work and practice to develop the skill can take many hours of dedication. Developing this mentality to succeed and achieve in video games has carried on throughout my life and has led me to be as dedicated as i am today.
